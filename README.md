# Blender-Curve-to-Hair
Blender macro to create particle hairs from beveled Bézier curves
The operator is named 'Curve to Hair'

⚠️ You must run the script before using the macro. 

⚠️ Does not support curves with 'PROFILE' bevel.

⚠️ Hairs don't always properly twist with 'OBJECT'-bevel curves

⚠️ Due to strange behavior with spline point tilt and hair twisting, all point tilts are flipped on the hair curve when the operator is run 

⚠️ Hair emitter will not follow the first curve point if you edit the curve
